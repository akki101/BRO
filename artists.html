This approach has yielded a remarkably high proportion of graduates who have established successful full-time careers as professional musicians both within Australia and overseas, as members of prominent orchestras, free-lancers, specialists in historically-informed performance on period instruments, instrumental teachers, and members of the armed services.</p></td>
